# Make cool documents with LaTeX
In this repository we have a lecture on a few reasons to use LaTeX, as well as an example of creating single-source, reproducible documents in the LaTeX language. The presentation is contained in the presentation folder. In the 'examples' folder, we have examples which we worked through in the lecture, from creating a tex document to adding a theme to integrating your code. These can be downloaded as templates for future work, as can the code for the presentation. In the final folder, we have my most recent statistics homework, which serves as an example of how to use this workflow for MSDS homework submissions

# Some resources and rabbit holes to fall down:
* Great place to start with latex https://github.com/egeerardyn/awesome-LaTeX
* Get started with tikz vector graphics (also worth looking at pstricks) https://github.com/xiaohanyu/awesome-tikz
* Yihui's amazing documentation on chunks https://yihui.name/knitr/options/


Look here for inspiration, you can make some really cool documents with LaTeX, from just formatting to animated vector graphics and beyond, all pretty easily. Feel free to email me at josephsd@smu.edu any time with LaTeX and knitr based questions, or to say hi!
