# Make cool documents with LaTeX
In this repository we have a lecture on a few reasons to use LaTeX, as well as an example of creating single-source, reproducible documents in the LaTeX language. The presentation is contained in the presentation folder. In the 'examples' folder, we have examples which we worked through in the lecture, from creating a tex document to adding a theme to integrating your code. These can be downloaded as templates for future work, as can the code for the presentation
